Library Management System (Java & MySQL in NetBeans)

The Library Management System is a desktop-based application developed using Java as the front-end and MySQL as the back-end database. The project was built and managed in the NetBeans IDE, which provides an integrated environment for coding, designing interfaces, and managing database connections.

This system is designed to automate and simplify the day-to-day operations of a library. It allows librarians and administrators to efficiently manage books, members, and transactions such as issuing and returning books. The system ensures accuracy, reduces manual paperwork, and provides quick access to important information.
